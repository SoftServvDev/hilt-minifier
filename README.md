<h1>HILT</h1>
<h2>Minifier Tool for CSS</h2>

<h3>Installation</h3>
This package is meant to be used in the commandline. You can use the npm command below to install it.

<p>*npm i hilt-minifier -g*</p>

This is a global NPM package, you can use it by using the hilt command in your terminal/command prompt. I plan on adding more file types if anyone is interested or in need of it, just email me at the address near the bottom of this page.

<h3>Flags</h3>
<p>-s (single file minifier)</p>
<p>-d (entire working directory file minifier)</p>
<p>-c (keep comments and minify)</p>
<p>-r (remove comments only)</p>


<h3>Usage</h3>

*hilt -s name.css*

The above command will allow you to completely minify the file "name.css" that is in the current working directory. You can include *-c* or *-r* after the file name if you want to implement those options.

HILT will automatically create a newly minified file without altering the original, and in the same working directory.

For a complete directory minify, use *hilt -d*. You can also use the *-c* and *-r* flags when performing an entire directory minify.

<h3>CLI Interface</h3>
The interface is easy to understand, and fully color-coded to help differentiate the important parts of the text. You can see some snippets below:
